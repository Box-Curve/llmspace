This proposal revolves around the use of ServiceNow SIR for all SOC tiers for ticket management and the ingestion of all Sentinel incident data into SIR. The strategy also involves using Defender/Sentinel for analysis and triage, with dashboards and metrics located in SIR.

The proposal notes a few common challenges. One is the need for Tier 1 to use the Defender suite outside of Sentinel for triage. Additionally, severity changes and assignments are currently not synced - with a side note that Active Directory Group names do not exist in ServiceNow.

The advantages of this proposal include:

1.  The use of MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) for Tier 1 triage.
2.  Tier 1 does not have to interact with ServiceNow Change/ITIL Incident, helping to avoid additional licensing costs.
3.  It offers a single pane for ticket management, standardizing metrics in one place for efficiency and ease of use.
4.  The proposal allows for CMDB-based automations and prioritization. This means Tier 1 can make priority decisions based on the criticality of the system - a capability not available in Sentinel.
5.  The system can redirect other tickets into queues like DLP to include I360, thus increasing versatility.
6.  The proposal is the preferred approach for Novacoast, a managed security services provider.
7.  Remote teams can access ServiceNow without the need for a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which is required for Sentinel access.

However, a con for this proposal is that syncing between systems can be delayed up to 60 seconds, though there's potential to reduce this.

In conclusion, this proposal focuses on centralizing SOC operations in ServiceNow SIR, and while there are a few cons to consider, it provides several advantages that could lead to more streamlined and efficient SOC operations.

Existing Comments are not Ported into SIR (no handover) Tier 0 & Tier1 do not benefit from CMDB enrichment Tier2 /3 cannot pass back to Tier1 once escalated Metrics split between Sentinel & SIR Assignment Group/Person not sync'd back to Sentinel

Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach to SOC operations. Specifically, Tier 1 would operate in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 would utilize ServiceNow SIR. It suggests that filtered Sentinel incident data should be ingested into SIR, and that analysis and triage should be conducted using information from both Defender and Sentinel. Dashboards and metrics would be divided between Sentinel and SIR.

This proposal shares some common challenges with the first one. These include the requirement for Tier 1 to refer to the Defender suite outside of Sentinel for triage, as well as the fact that severity changes and assignments are not currently synced between the platforms.

Pros of this proposal include:

1.  No Time Delay on Initial Detection: With Tier 1 operating in Sentinel, incidents can be detected and addressed instantly, eliminating the potential for sync delay.
2.  Auto-Resolve & Redirected Tickets: This proposal eliminates concerns about auto-resolve and redirected tickets, as they can be efficiently managed in Sentinel, although reporting on these from SIR may not be possible.

Cons of this proposal are:

1.  Difficult Tier Escalation Process: The communication and assignment synchronization between tiers may become difficult due to the split operational platforms.
2.  Existing Comments not Ported into SIR: There might be a loss of context during escalation as existing comments and observations from Tier 1 in Sentinel are not transferred into SIR.
3.  Limited CMDB Enrichment: Tier 0 and Tier 1 would not benefit from CMDB enrichment which can aid in priority decisions and automation.
4.  No Reassignment to Tier 1: Once escalated to Tier 2 or Tier 3, incidents cannot be reassigned back to Tier 1, possibly limiting efficiency and flexibility in managing workload.
5.  Metrics Split Between Sentinel and SIR: This might make it harder to maintain a unified view of SOC operations.
6.  Assignment Group/Person Not Sync'd Back to Sentinel: This could lead to issues in tracking incident ownership and responsibilities.

In conclusion, Proposal 2 offers a tiered approach to SOC operations, dividing ticket management tasks between Sentinel and ServiceNow SIR. While it can eliminate the time delay on initial incident detection, it introduces several challenges, including the complicated tier escalation process and potential issues in communication and data enrichment. Executives should weigh these factors against the needs and resources of their organization when considering this proposal.

Title: Strategic Enhancement of Security Operations Centre (SOC): A Non-Technical Overview

Dear Executives,

As the cyber landscape evolves, so must our strategies to manage and mitigate potential threats. Our Security Operations Centre (SOC) lies at the heart of this strategy, and the objective of this proposal is to optimize our SOC operations, considering a comprehensive approach to enhance its functioning and address vendor performance metrics.

Two key proposals have been identified for consideration:

1.  Proposal 1: All SOC Tiers work in ServiceNow SIR (Security Incident Response) for ticket management.
2.  Proposal 2: SOC Tier 1 works in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 work in ServiceNow SIR.

Proposal 1 suggests a unified approach where all SOC tiers work in SIR for ticket management, and all Sentinel incident data is ingested into SIR. This centralized approach aims to provide a single pane for ticket management and standardize metrics. It allows us to automate prioritization based on the criticality of the system, something that is currently not available in Sentinel. This approach is also preferred by our partner, Novacoast.

In contrast, Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach where Tier 1 operates in Sentinel for ticket management, and Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR. The key advantage of this proposal is the elimination of any time delay on initial incident detection, as incidents can be detected and addressed instantly.

\[Page 2\]

However, both proposals present certain limitations. For instance, both proposals require Tier 1 to refer to the Defender suite for triage. Also, the current lack of synchronization between severity changes and assignments between platforms needs to be addressed.

The main concern with Proposal 2 is its potential for introducing complexity due to the split operational platforms. This might result in a more difficult tier escalation process, potential loss of context during escalation due to non-transfer of comments, and a split in SOC metrics between Sentinel and SIR.

In contrast, Proposal 1 offers streamlined operations with some manageable challenges, such as potential data sync delay. Most importantly, Proposal 1 does not introduce any additional project cost impact.

Recommendation: Given the added complexity and potential issues associated with Proposal 2, the recommended course of action would be to adopt Proposal 1. This approach provides a centralized, unified, and efficient workflow that aligns with our partner's preferred approach and introduces no additional project costs.

Risk: It is crucial to note that adopting Proposal 1 may entail a potential sync delay. However, there is a potential to reduce this delay, and this risk can be managed with proper planning and implementation.

By adopting this comprehensive approach, our SOC can achieve improved efficiency, effectiveness, and overall security posture, providing value to our organization while meeting our cybersecurity objectives.

Thank you for your consideration.

The primary disadvantage of this approach is the potential for a sync delay in data. However, there are possibilities for reducing this delay with strategic planning and implementation.

III. Proposal 2: Tiered Approach to SOC Operations with Sentinel and ServiceNow SIR: The second proposal suggests SOC Tier 1 works in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR. The main advantages of this approach are:

1.  No time delay on initial detection
2.  Absence of issues related to Auto-Resolve & Redirected tickets

However, this approach introduces operational complexities, including difficulties in tier escalation, potential loss of context during escalation, and fragmentation in SOC metrics between Sentinel and SIR.

IV. Comparative Analysis & Recommendations: When comparing the two strategies, Proposal 1 appears to offer the most advantageous route. Centralization and standardization of operations provide a streamlined workflow and potentially lower cognitive load for analysts. Although the sync delay is a potential drawback, careful planning and correct implementation can mitigate this issue.

V. Risks: While Proposal 1 may present a risk of sync delay, mitigation strategies can be implemented to reduce this risk. Proposal 2, on the other hand, introduces the risk of operational complexity, with potential issues in escalation and fragmented SOC metrics.

VI. Conclusion: Given the alignment with Novacoast's preference, the potential for standardization, reduced complexity, and the lack of project cost impacts, Proposal 1 appears to be the optimal solution for enhancing SOC functionality. Implementing this proposal will streamline incident management, standardize metrics, and improve overall efficiency and effectiveness of the SOC. Future work could investigate optimal strategies for reducing sync delay in ServiceNow SIR.

**Title: Enhancing Security Operation Centre (SOC) Functionality: A Comparative Approach**

**Introduction**

The Security Operation Centre (SOC) serves as the nerve centre of an organization's cyber defence, and its effective operation is critical. Given this importance, this paper presents a comparative analysis of two proposals aimed at enhancing SOC functionality. We seek to aid executive decision-making by providing a comprehensive understanding of each proposal's merits and potential drawbacks.

**Proposals Under Consideration**

The first proposal suggests centralizing SOC operations in ServiceNow SIR, where all SOC tiers work for ticket management, and all Sentinel Incident data is ingested into SIR. Dashboards and Metrics are standardized in SIR, providing a unified view of operations.

The second proposal recommends a tiered approach to SOC operations, with Tier 1 working in Sentinel SIEM for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 operate within ServiceNow SIR. This approach leads to a split system, with dashboards and metrics in both Sentinel and SIR.

**Comparative Analysis**

**Benefits**

Proposal 1 offers benefits, such as a single pane for ticket management, standardized metrics, and the ability to use CMDB-based automations for prioritisation, which is absent in Sentinel. It allows redirection of tickets to other queues and does not require the use of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for remote teams to access ServiceNow, an advantage over Sentinel.

Proposal 2's strength lies in real-time incident detection, negating the time delay that may arise in Proposal 1 due to data synchronization. It also mitigates concerns regarding auto-resolve and redirected tickets.

**Limitations**

The potential data sync delay of up to 60 seconds in Proposal 1 is a notable drawback. On the other hand, Proposal 2 brings complexity into the SOC's incident management process. Challenges like difficult tier escalation, limited CMDB enrichment for Tier 0 and Tier 1, split metrics between Sentinel & SIR, and non-synced assignment groups/person are likely.

**Risk Assessment and Considerations**

Implementing either of these proposals involves potential risks and challenges. These include change management, integration complexities, the learning curve for SOC analysts, and the need to continuously monitor and improve workflows. Understanding these implications is essential in determining the most suitable course of action.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

Both proposals have their unique strengths and limitations. Proposal 1 suggests a unified, potentially streamlined approach, whereas Proposal 2 offers an advantage in incident detection speed but brings operational complexity.

Given the potential impact on SOC operations, a rigorous technical feasibility study is recommended for each proposal. Implementing a well-defined change management plan will be crucial, considering the change's sizeable scale and potential resistance that might be encountered. It will also be important to establish an ongoing monitoring and evaluation strategy to ensure the adopted changes deliver expected improvements.

While both proposals offer viable paths to enhancing SOC functionality, the final choice should align with the organization's specific needs, resources, and strategic objectives. Only through such a careful, tailored approach can the organization optimize its SOC operations, ensuring improved efficiency, effectiveness, and overall security posture.

> Explain that what an analyst in tier1 would want CMDB enhanced information in SIR

In Security Operation Centre (SOC) operations, Tier 1 analysts are typically the first responders to security incidents. These analysts review, triage, and handle the initial response to security events. One of the tools often employed in these tasks is a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), a repository that stores information about IT assets (also known as configuration items) and their relationships.

Integrating CMDB with ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) can significantly enhance the capabilities of Tier 1 analysts. Here's why:

**Contextual Information**: A CMDB can provide valuable contextual information about the assets involved in a security incident, such as their function, ownership, location, and how they interact with other assets. This information allows analysts to better understand the potential impact of the security incident and make more informed decisions during triage and response.

**Prioritization**: With the enhanced information from a CMDB, Tier 1 analysts can better prioritize incidents based on the criticality of the affected assets. For example, an incident affecting a critical server that supports key business operations may be prioritized higher than an incident affecting a less critical system.

**Incident Analysis and Response**: CMDB-enhanced information can also aid in the analysis and response to an incident. For instance, understanding the relationship between affected assets can help analysts identify the potential attack path or determine which other assets might be at risk. This can guide response actions, such as isolating affected systems or enhancing monitoring on potentially at-risk assets.

**Enhanced Collaboration**: With CMDB information available in SIR, it becomes easier for Tier 1 analysts to collaborate with other tiers or teams. They can quickly share comprehensive incident context, speeding up decision-making processes and making collaborations more efficient.

**Automation**: CMDB data can also be leveraged for automating certain SOC tasks. For example, workflows could be created that automatically escalate incidents involving specific critical assets, or that trigger specific response actions based on the type or location of an asset.

Overall, having CMDB-enhanced information in ServiceNow SIR equips Tier 1 analysts with a more complete view of the security landscape, helping them triage, respond to, and manage incidents more effectively.

Title: Options Paper: Enhancing Security Operation Centre Functionality through System Integration

I. Introduction:

Security Operation Centres (SOCs) play a pivotal role in monitoring and responding to security incidents. Effective SOCs leverage technology to optimize their operations and improve incident response times. This paper explores two options for enhancing SOC operations through integration with either ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) or Sentinel Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and assesses their respective advantages and limitations.

II. Proposal 1: Integrating All SOC Tiers with ServiceNow SIR

Proposal 1 suggests a centralized SOC approach, where all SOC tiers utilize ServiceNow SIR for ticket management and all Sentinel Incident data is ingested into SIR.

1.  Pros: Centralization in SIR enables streamlined ticket management and standardized metrics. Leveraging a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) enhances incident response by providing critical asset information, facilitating prioritization and decision-making processes for Tier 1 analysts. Additional advantages include a simplified system for redirecting tickets to other queues, and the elimination of the need for remote teams to use Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for accessing ServiceNow.
    
2.  Cons: One potential limitation is the delay of up to 60 seconds for data synchronization between systems. However, this delay might be reduced with further optimization.
    

III. Proposal 2: Differentiating SOC Tier Operations in Sentinel and SIR

Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach, where Tier 1 operates in Sentinel for ticket management, and Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR.

1.  Pros: Initial detection is real-time, and there are no concerns about auto-resolving and redirecting tickets.
    
2.  Cons: Difficulties arise in tier escalation due to comment and assignment sync issues, and metrics are split between Sentinel and SIR, which can hinder overall performance analysis. Additionally, Tiers 0 and 1 do not benefit from CMDB enrichment, limiting their access to critical asset information for incident response and prioritization.
    

IV. Importance of CMDB Integration in SIR for Tier 1 Analysts

A CMDB can provide Tier 1 analysts with valuable contextual information about the assets involved in a security incident, facilitating better understanding, prioritization, and response to incidents. Understanding the relationship between affected assets can guide response actions, aid collaboration, and enhance automation capabilities. Having CMDB-enhanced information in ServiceNow SIR equips Tier 1 analysts with a more comprehensive view of the security landscape.

V. Considerations and Recommendations

Both proposals involve some degree of complexity in implementation and require change management to ensure a smooth transition. Given the pros and cons of both options, Proposal 1 appears to offer more comprehensive benefits, especially with CMDB integration enhancing the capabilities of Tier 1 analysts. It is recommended that executives consider the specific needs, resources, and priorities of their organization when deciding on the most suitable course of action.

In conclusion, integrating SOC operations with ServiceNow SIR or Sentinel SIEM can significantly enhance SOC functionality, provided the choice of integration aligns with the organization's specific requirements and operational needs. It's crucial to continuously monitor and assess the impact on SOC efficiency, gathering feedback, tracking key performance indicators, and identifying areas for further improvement.

Title: Comprehensive SOC Integration into ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR): A Strategic Recommendation

**Executive Summary**

This strategic recommendation proposes a significant shift in our Security Operation Centre (SOC) operations—integrating all SOC tiers into the ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) platform. This move promises numerous benefits including operational efficiency, improved incident management, enhanced partner collaboration, and unified performance evaluation. Post full integration of Sentinel and SIR, anticipated to be live by July 2023, all SOC tiers are recommended to adopt SIR as the primary portal for incident response.

**I. Introduction**

In the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, the capability of our Security Operations Centre (SOC) to rapidly identify, investigate, and respond to incidents is pivotal to our organization's security posture. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance SOC performance and incident response, we propose a significant operational transition: the comprehensive integration of all SOC tiers into ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR). This paper delineates the rationale, potential benefits, and the proposed transition plan for this strategic integration.

**II. Current SOC Configuration and the Need for Integration**

Presently, the SOC Tier 1 team works exclusively out of Sentinel, while Tier 2 is transitioning towards SIR and Tier 3 manually manages incidents within SIR. This disparate configuration limits cross-tier visibility and collaboration, leading to potential inefficiencies in incident response. Integrating all SOC tiers into a singular platform, such as SIR, will facilitate seamless communication, enhanced visibility, and improved coordination amongst the tiers. Furthermore, the anticipated full integration of Sentinel into SIR by July 2023 underscores the potential benefits of adopting SIR as the primary portal for incident response.

**III. Advantages of Full Integration into SIR**

The strategic move to SIR promises several significant benefits:

1.  **Contextual Understanding of Enterprise Incidents:** Full integration provides SOC analysts at all tiers with a comprehensive view of changes and non-security incidents within the organization. Such an understanding allows for improved correlation analysis, providing a fuller context for all levels of investigation and thereby enhancing threat identification and response effectiveness.
    
2.  **Enhanced Automated Workflows:** SIR’s advanced capabilities in automating workflows will be accessible to all SOC tiers. Analysts will have full visibility and control over the incident response process, resulting in more effective and efficient responses.
    
3.  **Collaboration and Communication:** SIR’s design allows for better communication and collaboration between SOC tiers and with partners. Real-time sharing of incident data enables quicker and more coordinated responses, and joint decision-making processes become more efficient.
    
4.  **Unified Metrics and Performance Evaluation:** Consolidating SOC operations within a singular platform facilitates the generation of end-to-end metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of SOC performance, supporting better performance evaluation, benchmarking, and ultimately strategic decision making.
    
5.  **Standardized Practices:** By consolidating all SOC tiers within SIR, SOC operations can leverage the platform's capabilities for standardized practices, leading to further operational efficiency gains.
    

**IV. Transition Plan**

Given the strategic significance and the operational impact of the proposed transition, a rigorous and systematic implementation approach is required. Starting in June 2023, the integration process will commence with a testing phase to ensure operational readiness and mitigate potential risks. Following successful testing, a phased implementation will occur, with the full deployment expected by July 2023.

**V. Conclusion**

The full integration of all SOC tiers into ServiceNow SIR presents a pivotal step towards optimizing SOC operations. The proposed integration will not only provide more streamlined workflows and a comprehensive set of performance metrics, but also foster improved collaboration and a richer, more context-aware environment for incident investigation and response. By committing to continuous improvement and efficiency gains, we can ensure that our SOC continues to meet the
