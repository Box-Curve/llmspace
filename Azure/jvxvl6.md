This proposal revolves around the use of ServiceNow SIR for all SOC tiers for ticket management and the ingestion of all Sentinel incident data into SIR. The strategy also involves using Defender/Sentinel for analysis and triage, with dashboards and metrics located in SIR.

The proposal notes a few common challenges. One is the need for Tier 1 to use the Defender suite outside of Sentinel for triage. Additionally, severity changes and assignments are currently not synced - with a side note that Active Directory Group names do not exist in ServiceNow.

The advantages of this proposal include:

1.  The use of MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) for Tier 1 triage.
2.  Tier 1 does not have to interact with ServiceNow Change/ITIL Incident, helping to avoid additional licensing costs.
3.  It offers a single pane for ticket management, standardizing metrics in one place for efficiency and ease of use.
4.  The proposal allows for CMDB-based automations and prioritization. This means Tier 1 can make priority decisions based on the criticality of the system - a capability not available in Sentinel.
5.  The system can redirect other tickets into queues like DLP to include I360, thus increasing versatility.
6.  The proposal is the preferred approach for Novacoast, a managed security services provider.
7.  Remote teams can access ServiceNow without the need for a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which is required for Sentinel access.

However, a con for this proposal is that syncing between systems can be delayed up to 60 seconds, though there's potential to reduce this.

In conclusion, this proposal focuses on centralizing SOC operations in ServiceNow SIR, and while there are a few cons to consider, it provides several advantages that could lead to more streamlined and efficient SOC operations.

Existing Comments are not Ported into SIR (no handover) Tier 0 & Tier1 do not benefit from CMDB enrichment Tier2 /3 cannot pass back to Tier1 once escalated Metrics split between Sentinel & SIR Assignment Group/Person not sync'd back to Sentinel

Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach to SOC operations. Specifically, Tier 1 would operate in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 would utilize ServiceNow SIR. It suggests that filtered Sentinel incident data should be ingested into SIR, and that analysis and triage should be conducted using information from both Defender and Sentinel. Dashboards and metrics would be divided between Sentinel and SIR.

This proposal shares some common challenges with the first one. These include the requirement for Tier 1 to refer to the Defender suite outside of Sentinel for triage, as well as the fact that severity changes and assignments are not currently synced between the platforms.

Pros of this proposal include:

1.  No Time Delay on Initial Detection: With Tier 1 operating in Sentinel, incidents can be detected and addressed instantly, eliminating the potential for sync delay.
2.  Auto-Resolve & Redirected Tickets: This proposal eliminates concerns about auto-resolve and redirected tickets, as they can be efficiently managed in Sentinel, although reporting on these from SIR may not be possible.

Cons of this proposal are:

1.  Difficult Tier Escalation Process: The communication and assignment synchronization between tiers may become difficult due to the split operational platforms.
2.  Existing Comments not Ported into SIR: There might be a loss of context during escalation as existing comments and observations from Tier 1 in Sentinel are not transferred into SIR.
3.  Limited CMDB Enrichment: Tier 0 and Tier 1 would not benefit from CMDB enrichment which can aid in priority decisions and automation.
4.  No Reassignment to Tier 1: Once escalated to Tier 2 or Tier 3, incidents cannot be reassigned back to Tier 1, possibly limiting efficiency and flexibility in managing workload.
5.  Metrics Split Between Sentinel and SIR: This might make it harder to maintain a unified view of SOC operations.
6.  Assignment Group/Person Not Sync'd Back to Sentinel: This could lead to issues in tracking incident ownership and responsibilities.

In conclusion, Proposal 2 offers a tiered approach to SOC operations, dividing ticket management tasks between Sentinel and ServiceNow SIR. While it can eliminate the time delay on initial incident detection, it introduces several challenges, including the complicated tier escalation process and potential issues in communication and data enrichment. Executives should weigh these factors against the needs and resources of their organization when considering this proposal.

Title: Strategic Enhancement of Security Operations Centre (SOC): A Non-Technical Overview

Dear Executives,

As the cyber landscape evolves, so must our strategies to manage and mitigate potential threats. Our Security Operations Centre (SOC) lies at the heart of this strategy, and the objective of this proposal is to optimize our SOC operations, considering a comprehensive approach to enhance its functioning and address vendor performance metrics.

Two key proposals have been identified for consideration:

1.  Proposal 1: All SOC Tiers work in ServiceNow SIR (Security Incident Response) for ticket management.
2.  Proposal 2: SOC Tier 1 works in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 work in ServiceNow SIR.

Proposal 1 suggests a unified approach where all SOC tiers work in SIR for ticket management, and all Sentinel incident data is ingested into SIR. This centralized approach aims to provide a single pane for ticket management and standardize metrics. It allows us to automate prioritization based on the criticality of the system, something that is currently not available in Sentinel. This approach is also preferred by our partner, Novacoast.

In contrast, Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach where Tier 1 operates in Sentinel for ticket management, and Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR. The key advantage of this proposal is the elimination of any time delay on initial incident detection, as incidents can be detected and addressed instantly.

\[Page 2\]

However, both proposals present certain limitations. For instance, both proposals require Tier 1 to refer to the Defender suite for triage. Also, the current lack of synchronization between severity changes and assignments between platforms needs to be addressed.

The main concern with Proposal 2 is its potential for introducing complexity due to the split operational platforms. This might result in a more difficult tier escalation process, potential loss of context during escalation due to non-transfer of comments, and a split in SOC metrics between Sentinel and SIR.

In contrast, Proposal 1 offers streamlined operations with some manageable challenges, such as potential data sync delay. Most importantly, Proposal 1 does not introduce any additional project cost impact.

Recommendation: Given the added complexity and potential issues associated with Proposal 2, the recommended course of action would be to adopt Proposal 1. This approach provides a centralized, unified, and efficient workflow that aligns with our partner's preferred approach and introduces no additional project costs.

Risk: It is crucial to note that adopting Proposal 1 may entail a potential sync delay. However, there is a potential to reduce this delay, and this risk can be managed with proper planning and implementation.

By adopting this comprehensive approach, our SOC can achieve improved efficiency, effectiveness, and overall security posture, providing value to our organization while meeting our cybersecurity objectives.

Thank you for your consideration.

The primary disadvantage of this approach is the potential for a sync delay in data. However, there are possibilities for reducing this delay with strategic planning and implementation.

III. Proposal 2: Tiered Approach to SOC Operations with Sentinel and ServiceNow SIR: The second proposal suggests SOC Tier 1 works in Sentinel for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR. The main advantages of this approach are:

1.  No time delay on initial detection
2.  Absence of issues related to Auto-Resolve & Redirected tickets

However, this approach introduces operational complexities, including difficulties in tier escalation, potential loss of context during escalation, and fragmentation in SOC metrics between Sentinel and SIR.

IV. Comparative Analysis & Recommendations: When comparing the two strategies, Proposal 1 appears to offer the most advantageous route. Centralization and standardization of operations provide a streamlined workflow and potentially lower cognitive load for analysts. Although the sync delay is a potential drawback, careful planning and correct implementation can mitigate this issue.

V. Risks: While Proposal 1 may present a risk of sync delay, mitigation strategies can be implemented to reduce this risk. Proposal 2, on the other hand, introduces the risk of operational complexity, with potential issues in escalation and fragmented SOC metrics.

VI. Conclusion: Given the alignment with Novacoast's preference, the potential for standardization, reduced complexity, and the lack of project cost impacts, Proposal 1 appears to be the optimal solution for enhancing SOC functionality. Implementing this proposal will streamline incident management, standardize metrics, and improve overall efficiency and effectiveness of the SOC. Future work could investigate optimal strategies for reducing sync delay in ServiceNow SIR.

**Title: Enhancing Security Operation Centre (SOC) Functionality: A Comparative Approach**

**Introduction**

The Security Operation Centre (SOC) serves as the nerve centre of an organization's cyber defence, and its effective operation is critical. Given this importance, this paper presents a comparative analysis of two proposals aimed at enhancing SOC functionality. We seek to aid executive decision-making by providing a comprehensive understanding of each proposal's merits and potential drawbacks.

**Proposals Under Consideration**

The first proposal suggests centralizing SOC operations in ServiceNow SIR, where all SOC tiers work for ticket management, and all Sentinel Incident data is ingested into SIR. Dashboards and Metrics are standardized in SIR, providing a unified view of operations.

The second proposal recommends a tiered approach to SOC operations, with Tier 1 working in Sentinel SIEM for ticket management, while Tiers 2 and 3 operate within ServiceNow SIR. This approach leads to a split system, with dashboards and metrics in both Sentinel and SIR.

**Comparative Analysis**

**Benefits**

Proposal 1 offers benefits, such as a single pane for ticket management, standardized metrics, and the ability to use CMDB-based automations for prioritisation, which is absent in Sentinel. It allows redirection of tickets to other queues and does not require the use of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for remote teams to access ServiceNow, an advantage over Sentinel.

Proposal 2's strength lies in real-time incident detection, negating the time delay that may arise in Proposal 1 due to data synchronization. It also mitigates concerns regarding auto-resolve and redirected tickets.

**Limitations**

The potential data sync delay of up to 60 seconds in Proposal 1 is a notable drawback. On the other hand, Proposal 2 brings complexity into the SOC's incident management process. Challenges like difficult tier escalation, limited CMDB enrichment for Tier 0 and Tier 1, split metrics between Sentinel & SIR, and non-synced assignment groups/person are likely.

**Risk Assessment and Considerations**

Implementing either of these proposals involves potential risks and challenges. These include change management, integration complexities, the learning curve for SOC analysts, and the need to continuously monitor and improve workflows. Understanding these implications is essential in determining the most suitable course of action.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

Both proposals have their unique strengths and limitations. Proposal 1 suggests a unified, potentially streamlined approach, whereas Proposal 2 offers an advantage in incident detection speed but brings operational complexity.

Given the potential impact on SOC operations, a rigorous technical feasibility study is recommended for each proposal. Implementing a well-defined change management plan will be crucial, considering the change's sizeable scale and potential resistance that might be encountered. It will also be important to establish an ongoing monitoring and evaluation strategy to ensure the adopted changes deliver expected improvements.

While both proposals offer viable paths to enhancing SOC functionality, the final choice should align with the organization's specific needs, resources, and strategic objectives. Only through such a careful, tailored approach can the organization optimize its SOC operations, ensuring improved efficiency, effectiveness, and overall security posture.

> Explain that what an analyst in tier1 would want CMDB enhanced information in SIR

In Security Operation Centre (SOC) operations, Tier 1 analysts are typically the first responders to security incidents. These analysts review, triage, and handle the initial response to security events. One of the tools often employed in these tasks is a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), a repository that stores information about IT assets (also known as configuration items) and their relationships.

Integrating CMDB with ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) can significantly enhance the capabilities of Tier 1 analysts. Here's why:

**Contextual Information**: A CMDB can provide valuable contextual information about the assets involved in a security incident, such as their function, ownership, location, and how they interact with other assets. This information allows analysts to better understand the potential impact of the security incident and make more informed decisions during triage and response.

**Prioritization**: With the enhanced information from a CMDB, Tier 1 analysts can better prioritize incidents based on the criticality of the affected assets. For example, an incident affecting a critical server that supports key business operations may be prioritized higher than an incident affecting a less critical system.

**Incident Analysis and Response**: CMDB-enhanced information can also aid in the analysis and response to an incident. For instance, understanding the relationship between affected assets can help analysts identify the potential attack path or determine which other assets might be at risk. This can guide response actions, such as isolating affected systems or enhancing monitoring on potentially at-risk assets.

**Enhanced Collaboration**: With CMDB information available in SIR, it becomes easier for Tier 1 analysts to collaborate with other tiers or teams. They can quickly share comprehensive incident context, speeding up decision-making processes and making collaborations more efficient.

**Automation**: CMDB data can also be leveraged for automating certain SOC tasks. For example, workflows could be created that automatically escalate incidents involving specific critical assets, or that trigger specific response actions based on the type or location of an asset.

Overall, having CMDB-enhanced information in ServiceNow SIR equips Tier 1 analysts with a more complete view of the security landscape, helping them triage, respond to, and manage incidents more effectively.

Title: Options Paper: Enhancing Security Operation Centre Functionality through System Integration

I. Introduction:

Security Operation Centres (SOCs) play a pivotal role in monitoring and responding to security incidents. Effective SOCs leverage technology to optimize their operations and improve incident response times. This paper explores two options for enhancing SOC operations through integration with either ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) or Sentinel Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and assesses their respective advantages and limitations.

II. Proposal 1: Integrating All SOC Tiers with ServiceNow SIR

Proposal 1 suggests a centralized SOC approach, where all SOC tiers utilize ServiceNow SIR for ticket management and all Sentinel Incident data is ingested into SIR.

1.  Pros: Centralization in SIR enables streamlined ticket management and standardized metrics. Leveraging a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) enhances incident response by providing critical asset information, facilitating prioritization and decision-making processes for Tier 1 analysts. Additional advantages include a simplified system for redirecting tickets to other queues, and the elimination of the need for remote teams to use Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for accessing ServiceNow.
    
2.  Cons: One potential limitation is the delay of up to 60 seconds for data synchronization between systems. However, this delay might be reduced with further optimization.
    

III. Proposal 2: Differentiating SOC Tier Operations in Sentinel and SIR

Proposal 2 suggests a tiered approach, where Tier 1 operates in Sentinel for ticket management, and Tiers 2 and 3 utilize ServiceNow SIR.

1.  Pros: Initial detection is real-time, and there are no concerns about auto-resolving and redirecting tickets.
    
2.  Cons: Difficulties arise in tier escalation due to comment and assignment sync issues, and metrics are split between Sentinel and SIR, which can hinder overall performance analysis. Additionally, Tiers 0 and 1 do not benefit from CMDB enrichment, limiting their access to critical asset information for incident response and prioritization.
    

IV. Importance of CMDB Integration in SIR for Tier 1 Analysts

A CMDB can provide Tier 1 analysts with valuable contextual information about the assets involved in a security incident, facilitating better understanding, prioritization, and response to incidents. Understanding the relationship between affected assets can guide response actions, aid collaboration, and enhance automation capabilities. Having CMDB-enhanced information in ServiceNow SIR equips Tier 1 analysts with a more comprehensive view of the security landscape.

V. Considerations and Recommendations

Both proposals involve some degree of complexity in implementation and require change management to ensure a smooth transition. Given the pros and cons of both options, Proposal 1 appears to offer more comprehensive benefits, especially with CMDB integration enhancing the capabilities of Tier 1 analysts. It is recommended that executives consider the specific needs, resources, and priorities of their organization when deciding on the most suitable course of action.

In conclusion, integrating SOC operations with ServiceNow SIR or Sentinel SIEM can significantly enhance SOC functionality, provided the choice of integration aligns with the organization's specific requirements and operational needs. It's crucial to continuously monitor and assess the impact on SOC efficiency, gathering feedback, tracking key performance indicators, and identifying areas for further improvement.

By consolidating the overview and comparison into one slide, we've kept the main points while creating a more concise presentation. Let me know if there are any further adjustments you'd like.

> focus only on slide 1 for now. A core requirement is that the SOAR integrates into the organisation by triggering workflows such as the creation of changes and the triggering of actions for our partners in the interprise that would resolve issues. compare the twi approches though this lens

**Slide 1: Overview and Comparison of SOAR Scenarios**

*   Scenario 1: Implementing SOAR capabilities from Sentinel
    
    *   Integration: Though Sentinel integrates well with the broader Azure ecosystem, triggering workflows and creating changes outside of this ecosystem, especially in an environment unfamiliar with Logic Apps, can prove challenging and may require custom scripting or third-party connectors.
    *   Actions for Partners: Azure Logic Apps can interface with various third-party applications via connectors, but this demands in-depth Azure expertise to deploy effectively. Moreover, seamless communication with partner organizations might necessitate custom development work.
*   Scenario 2: Implementing SOAR capabilities from ServiceNow
    
    *   Integration: As ServiceNow SIR is built on the robust ServiceNow platform, it can readily trigger workflows, create changes, and initiate ITSM processes like Incident, Problem, and Change management in the same environment. This native integration reduces complexity and increases efficiency.
    *   Actions for Partners: ServiceNow SIR provides a powerful and flexible platform to automate and orchestrate security tasks with partners. It offers extensive capabilities to create, track, and manage tasks across different departments or even organizations, providing a seamless, unified view of actions and responses.

In the context of integration with organizational workflows and enabling actions with partners, ServiceNow SIR appears to offer more straightforward, out-of-the-box capabilities. However, both options can potentially meet these requirements, given sufficient expertise and resources for custom development and integration work.

> Remember we have the workflows in ServiceNow already. We have sentinel and SIR deplyed. THe use of servicenow is very mature in the bank. There is very little experioence of Azure or Sentinel in the Bank. To use Sentinel we would need to integrate the logic apps into servicenow to trigger the creation of change and custom workflows, talk about this in the comparison.

**Slide 1: Overview and Comparison of SOAR Scenarios**

*   Scenario 1: Implementing SOAR capabilities from Sentinel
    
    *   Integration: Sentinel is already deployed but the bank has limited experience in Azure and Sentinel. While Sentinel has strong integration with Azure components, interfacing it with ServiceNow's workflows to trigger changes and custom workflows requires significant expertise in Logic Apps and potentially custom scripting. Such integrations could also require considerable maintenance and oversight to ensure seamless operation.
    *   Actions for Partners: To enable actions for partners, Logic Apps would need to interact with various third-party applications via connectors. This demands deep Azure expertise and potentially custom development work, which is not readily available in the bank.
*   Scenario 2: Implementing SOAR capabilities from ServiceNow
    
    *   Integration: ServiceNow is mature within the bank, with established workflows already in place. Implementing SOAR capabilities with ServiceNow SIR would leverage this existing foundation and readily integrate with the bank's existing processes. This minimizes the need for extensive custom development and lowers the risk associated with the implementation.
    *   Actions for Partners: ServiceNow SIR is equipped to automate and orchestrate security tasks involving partners. It allows tasks to be created, tracked, and managed across different departments or even organizations, offering a seamless, unified view of actions and responses.

In considering the bank's existing maturity with ServiceNow, and the challenges of integrating Sentinel's SOAR capabilities into ServiceNow's established workflows, the implementation of SOAR capabilities with ServiceNow SIR presents as a more manageable and less risky option. It aligns more readily with the bank's existing knowledge base and processes, minimizes the need for custom development, and reduces reliance on hard-to-find Azure expertise.

> reove the actions from partners and include pros and cons

**Slide 1: Overview and Comparison of SOAR Scenarios**

*   Scenario 1: Implementing SOAR capabilities from Sentinel

    *   Pros:
        *   Seamless integration within Azure environments, making use of prebuilt connectors for Azure services.
        *   Robust threat intelligence and incident response tools.
    *   Cons:
        *   Limited experience within the bank on Azure and Sentinel might result in longer implementation time.
        *   Integrating Sentinel's SOAR with ServiceNow for workflow and change management could be complex, require custom scripting, and require ongoing maintenance.
        *   Could necessitate more training and upskilling of current teams or recruitment of Azure and Sentinel specialists.
*   Scenario 2: Implementing SOAR capabilities from ServiceNow SIR
    
    *   Integration: ServiceNow's SIR module provides built-in SOAR capabilities and readily integrates with the bank's existing ServiceNow workflows.
    *   Pros:
        *   ServiceNow is a mature tool within the bank, lowering the learning curve and speeding up implementation.
        *   Leverages existing ServiceNow workflows and processes, reducing the need for custom development.
        *   Consolidates security incident response and SOAR capabilities into a single platform, providing a unified view of security posture.
    *   Cons:
        *   While ServiceNow offers integration with a wide variety of tools, these integrations may require additional configuration and testing compared to Sentinel's native integrations within the Azure environment.
        *   Requires additional license cost for ServiceNow SIR, if not already licensed.

In considering the bank's existing familiarity with ServiceNow, the potential complexity of integrating Sentinel's SOAR with ServiceNow's workflows, and the resources required for each scenario, the implementation of SOAR capabilities with ServiceNow SIR appears more aligned with the bank's current skills and processes, and potentially more efficient in terms of implementation time and resources.

> the model for the SOC is that analysts will be using SIR as the primary pain of glass and that Sentinel and other toold will be used for investigations

Given this operating model, implementing ServiceNow SIR as the primary SOAR platform makes more strategic sense as it can provide a single, unified interface for SOC analysts, leveraging the existing familiarity with ServiceNow. This would reduce the complexity of having to switch between different tools for incident response and investigation.

Using ServiceNow SIR, SOC analysts would have immediate access to incident details, related tickets, and threat intelligence all within one system. The analysts can then initiate appropriate responses and trigger automated workflows directly from within ServiceNow. This would streamline the incident response process and improve efficiency.

While Sentinel could also provide a range of SOAR capabilities, its integration with ServiceNow might be more complex and potentially disjointed, requiring analysts to work across two different platforms. This could lead to inefficiencies and potential points of failure in the incident response process.

The choice of ServiceNow SIR as the primary SOAR platform also allows for a smoother transition for SOC analysts, as they are already accustomed to ServiceNow's interface and functionality. This means less time spent on training and adaptation, and more time focusing on the core task of responding to security incidents.

As such, the use of ServiceNow SIR as the primary SOAR solution appears to provide a more efficient and streamlined process for the SOC analysts and the broader organization.

> provide a summarisation of the this discussion in 11 bullets

1.  ServiceNow SIR provides a unified platform for incident management, reducing the need for analysts to switch between multiple tools.
2.  The use of ServiceNow SIR capitalizes on existing familiarity with ServiceNow, reducing the learning curve and transition time for SOC analysts.

"In an effort to optimize our Security Operations Center (SOC) and drive operational efficiency, we have examined the potential of two leading platforms: ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) and Microsoft Sentinel. The goal is to streamline our incident response process, leverage automation wherever feasible, and provide a single pane of glass for our SOC analysts. This brief provides a comparison of these two platforms with an emphasis on their integration with existing infrastructure, their capacity to drive automated workflows, and their potential to fit seamlessly into our operational model. Through this analysis, we aim to facilitate an informed decision on the best approach for our organization."

> If i want to trigger a power app from SIR and then have the power app write back to SIR would i need to create a custom integration in SIR for every power app

As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, creating a custom integration in ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) for each Power App would not be necessary. Rather, a more efficient way would be to establish a general purpose integration between ServiceNow SIR and Power Apps, using ServiceNow's REST APIs or possibly a pre-built connector if available.

Here's a general idea of how it could work:

1.  ServiceNow SIR triggers a Power App: When certain conditions are met in ServiceNow SIR (e.g., a specific type of security incident is created), a REST API call could be made to Power Apps to trigger a specific app. The API call could include relevant details from the security incident, such as incident ID, severity, etc.
    
2.  Power App writes back to ServiceNow SIR: After the Power App has completed its task, it could make a REST API call back to ServiceNow SIR to update the security incident. This could include changing the incident status, adding comments, attaching files, etc.
    

By creating a general-purpose API endpoint in ServiceNow SIR and Power Apps, you could potentially trigger multiple different Power Apps and have them write back to SIR without needing to create a custom integration for each one. However, please note that specific implementation details could vary depending on the unique needs of your organization and any updates to ServiceNow and Power Apps functionality after September 2021.

Before you start this kind of implementation, it's recommended to consult with a solution architect or a professional who has recent and specific experience in integrating ServiceNow with Power Apps to confirm this approach.

> descripbe the simple steps of sentinel triggering a soar action with a power app and trigering a change creation task in servicenow. do this in bullet for for a presentation. keep it very brief

1.  **Incident Detection**: Sentinel detects a security incident based on defined rules and generates an alert.
    
2.  **SOAR Activation**: Sentinel triggers a Power App via Logic Apps as part of its Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) process.
    
3.  **Power App Execution**: The Power App executes the defined task, such as gathering additional data, isolating a system, or disabling a user account.
    
4.  **ServiceNow Integration**: Once the Power App task is complete, it sends a signal back to Sentinel.
    
5.  **Change Creation**: Sentinel, upon receiving the signal, communicates with ServiceNow via API or a pre-built connector to create a change request.
    
6.  **Change Management**: The change request undergoes the defined workflow in ServiceNow for review, approval, implementation, and closure.
    

Please note, these are simplified steps and the actual process may involve additional steps or variations depending on your specific configuration and requirements.

> now do the same but use SIR as the promary SOAR

1.  **Incident Detection**: Sentinel detects a security incident based on defined rules and sends an alert to ServiceNow SIR.
    
2.  **Incident Ingestion**: ServiceNow SIR ingests the alert and creates an incident ticket.
    
3.  **SOAR Activation**: ServiceNow SIR, as part of its Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), triggers the defined workflow associated with the incident type.
    
4.  **Automated Action Execution**: The workflow executes the defined tasks, such as gathering additional data, isolating a system, or disabling a user account.
    
5.  **Change Creation**: If the workflow determines a change is needed, it automatically creates a change request within ServiceNow.
    
6.  **Change Management**: The change request undergoes the defined workflow in ServiceNow for review, approval, implementation, and closure.
    

Please note, these are simplified steps and the actual process may involve additional steps or variations depending on your specific configuration and requirements.

> sho the pros and cons for both options note that amount of touch point and integrations required from SIR are fewer as this is the priomary pan of lgass for the SOC

Using Sentinel and PowerApps for SOAR Actions
---------------------------------------------

**Pros**:

1.  **Direct Action**: As the detection engine, Sentinel can potentially trigger PowerApps to perform SOAR actions directly.
2.  **Existing Setup**: If your organization already uses Sentinel extensively, you may leverage existing setup and resources.

**Cons**:

1.  **Complexity**: The integration of Sentinel, PowerApps, and ServiceNow requires developing and maintaining multiple touchpoints and APIs, which could increase the complexity and the possibility of errors.
2.  **Expertise**: Limited Azure and Sentinel expertise in the organization could impact the efficiency of this solution. Adequate training or new hiring may be required.
3.  **Limited Single Pane of Glass**: SOC analysts might still have to navigate between Sentinel and ServiceNow, reducing the effectiveness of ServiceNow as a single pane of glass for incident management.

Using ServiceNow SIR for SOAR Actions
-------------------------------------

**Pros**:

1.  **Simplified Workflow**: Using ServiceNow SIR as the primary SOAR simplifies workflows by reducing the number of required integrations and touchpoints.
2.  **Single Pane of Glass**: Enhances ServiceNow SIR's role as the primary portal for incident response, ensuring all actions can be tracked in one place.
3.  **Leverage Existing Resources**: Utilizes the organization's existing maturity in ServiceNow use, which could result in a quicker implementation and adoption.
4.  **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: All SOAR actions, including the creation of changes, are recorded and tracked in ServiceNow, improving accountability and traceability.

**Cons**:

1.  **Potential Delays**: Depending on the configuration, there might be minor delays in initiating SOAR actions in ServiceNow SIR following a Sentinel alert.
2.  **Requires ServiceNow Expertise**: Requires a good understanding of ServiceNow and its various modules, which may require further training for the SOC team.

From these points, it appears that using ServiceNow SIR for SOAR actions would be more beneficial for your organization, considering the limited Azure and Sentinel expertise and the already established use of ServiceNow.
