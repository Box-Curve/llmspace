1 / 1

Creating an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) of Red Hat servers running Logstash involves several steps, ranging from setting up a resource group in Azure to deploying the scale set and installing Logstash on the virtual machines.

### Prerequisites

1.  Azure CLI or Azure Portal Access
2.  SSH Key Pair for VM Authentication
3.  A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Azure VM image
4.  Basic understanding of Azure, Linux, and Logstash

### Steps to Create Azure VM Scale Set

#### Step 1: Install and Configure Azure CLI

If you haven't installed the Azure CLI, download and install it from the [official page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

#### Step 2: Log in to Azure

Open a command prompt and type:

bash

```bash
az login
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to log in.

#### Step 3: Create a Resource Group

Choose a name and a location for the resource group:

bash

```bash
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

#### Step 4: Create the VM Scale Set

In this example, we're using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 image to create a scale set with 3 instances:

bash

```bash
az vmss create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --image RedHat:RHEL:7.4:latest \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
  --instance-count 3
```

#### Step 5: Open Ports

If you want to open specific ports, like 22 for SSH and 5044 for Logstash:

bash

```bash
az vmss security-group rule create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --name allowSSHLogstash \
  --priority 100 \
  --description "Allow SSH and Logstash Traffic" \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --destination-port-ranges 22 5044
```

### Steps to Install Logstash on VM Instances

#### Step 1: Connect to an Instance

SSH into one of the instances in the scale set.

#### Step 2: Download and Install Logstash

To download and install Logstash, follow the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html). For RHEL, you'd typically use `yum`:

bash

```bash
sudo yum install logstash
```

#### Step 3: Configure Logstash

Edit the Logstash configuration as needed, typically located at `/etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf`.

#### Step 4: Start Logstash Service

Start Logstash with:

bash

```bash
sudo systemctl start logstash
```

### Automate Logstash Installation

To automate the installation of Logstash on all VM instances in the scale set, you can use Azure VMSS extensions or use a configuration management tool like Ansible.

For example, to use Azure VMSS extensions with a script:

1.  Create a Bash script `install-logstash.sh` with the Logstash installation commands.
2.  Upload it to a location accessible by the VM instances.
3.  Use the `az vmss extension set` command to set this script as an extension:

bash

```bash
az vmss extension set \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vmss-name myScaleSet \
  --name customScript \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
  --settings "{'scriptUrl':'<URL_to_install-logstash.sh_script>', 'fileUris': ['<other_needed_files>']}"
```

Replace `<URL_to_install-logstash.sh_script>` and `<other_needed_files>` with the appropriate paths.

Now, each instance in the scale set should run the script and install Logstash when they are initialized.

This gives you an overview of setting up an Azure VM Scale Set running Logstash on Red Hat servers. Fine-tune as needed for your specific requirements.

1 / 1

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) provide high availability to your applications, and they scale automatically according to configured metrics. The basic idea behind VMSS is to deploy and manage multiple identical VMs as a set. Here's how they function:

### Components:

1.  **Instance**: An individual VM that is a part of a Scale Set.
2.  **Load Balancer**: Optional, but often used to distribute incoming traffic across instances.
3.  **Scaling Policy**: Rules that trigger the scale-out (increase instances) or scale-in (decrease instances) actions based on specific metrics, such as CPU utilization.

### Key Functionality:

1.  **High Availability**: VMSS are spread across multiple fault domains and update domains in Azure to ensure that the entire set isn't affected by single points of failure.
    
2.  **Auto-Scaling**: You can set up autoscaling based on CPU usage, disk I/O, network I/O, etc. When a particular metric crosses a threshold, Azure can automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances.
    
3.  **Load Balancing**: VMSS can be configured with Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway to distribute traffic among instances. This ensures that no single instance is overwhelmed.
    
4.  **Uniformity**: All VM instances are configured the same, based on the VMSS configuration. This is particularly useful for stateless applications.
    
5.  **Update Orchestration**: You can orchestrate updates to your VMs in a rolling fashion, minimizing downtime.
    
6.  **Customization**: Despite the uniformity, you can also inject some level of customization into each VM instance using VM extensions. For example, you could use a custom script to download and install software when a new VM is created.
    

### How Scaling Works:

1.  **Manual Scaling**: You can manually increase or decrease the instance count.
    
2.  **Auto-Scaling**: Using Azure Monitor and Autoscale settings, you can set thresholds for metrics like CPU utilization that will automatically increase or decrease the number of instances.
    
3.  **Custom Autoscaling**: You can also use Azure Functions or Logic Apps to implement custom autoscaling logic, which can be triggered based on complex metrics or third-party data.
    

### Scaling Operations:

1.  **Scale Out**: When the metrics you've defined go beyond a certain threshold, Azure will automatically provision new VMs based on the original VM image and configuration.
    
2.  **Scale In**: When the metrics fall below another threshold, Azure can automatically remove VMs from the set, according to a policy (e.g., remove the least recently created).
    
3.  **Cooldown Periods**: These are periods during which Azure will not attempt to scale in or out, to avoid constant fluctuations.
    
4.  **Evaluation Periods**: Azure uses this to assess whether the scaling action has produced the desired effect on the metrics.
    

In summary, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets offer a highly scalable and customizable service for hosting identical VMs. They are especially useful for hosting large-scale, stateless applications that require high availability and automatic scaling.

> where is the vmss extension hosted

1 / 1

Azure VMSS extensions are not hosted by the user, but rather, they are managed by Azure itself. These extensions are a part of the Azure platform, and they allow you to configure, bootstrap, or set software on each VM instance in the scale set without having to manually intervene.

When you define a VMSS, you can specify which extensions to include in its configuration. Once the VMSS is deployed, Azure ensures that these extensions are executed on each VM instance that is part of the scale set, both existing and newly created ones.

You can specify the settings and protected settings for each extension, which might include things like script file URLs, command lines to execute, or other parameters. These settings are typically provided in the form of a JSON object during the VMSS creation, either via Azure Portal, Azure CLI, ARM templates, or SDKs.

### Where do the scripts or files for the extensions come from?

1.  **Azure Storage**: You can host your script files or installation packages on Azure Blob Storage and make them accessible through a URL.
    
2.  **GitHub or other public repositories**: If your script files are publicly accessible, you can point the extension directly to these URLs.
    
3.  **Azure DevOps or other CI/CD tools**: If you are deploying VMSS as a part of your CI/CD pipeline, your scripts could be pulled directly from your source control as a part of the build/release pipeline.
    

### Example with Azure CLI for a custom script:

Here's how you might add an extension to a VMSS that runs a custom script hosted on Azure Blob Storage:

bash

```bash
az vmss extension set \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vmss-name myScaleSet \
  --name customScript \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
  --settings "{'scriptUrl':'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscripts/myscript.sh', 'fileUris': ['https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscripts/dependency1.sh']}"
```

In this example, the `scriptUrl` and `fileUris` settings point to where the custom script and its dependencies are hosted (Azure Blob Storage in this case).

### Azure Managed Extensions:

Microsoft and other third parties also provide a series of managed extensions for common tasks like configuring monitoring, installing agents, and so on. These managed extensions are automatically hosted and managed by Azure.

Sure! Below is a sample Terraform template that sets up an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) with Red Hat Linux VMs and a custom script extension for installing Logstash.

Before using this template, please install Terraform and authenticate it with your Azure account. Save this code in a file with a `.tf` extension, such as `azure_vmss.tf`.

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  security_rule {

  }

  extension {
    name                 = "hostname"

    type                 = "CustomScript"

    settings = jsonencode({
      "scriptUrl" = "http://path/to/your/install-logstash.sh"
      "fileUris"  = ["http://path/to/your/dependency1.sh"]
    })
  }
}
```

Replace `"http://path/to/your/install-logstash.sh"` and `"http://path/to/your/dependency1.sh"` with the actual URLs where your Logstash installation script and its dependencies are located.

Once your Terraform file is ready:

1.  Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform with the required providers.
2.  Run `terraform plan` to see what changes will be made.
3.  Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the resources.

This will create a VMSS with 3 instances of Red Hat 7.4, with ports 22 and 5044 open, and it will run the custom script to install Logstash as specified. Adjust the configurations according to your requirements.

Certainly, the following is an updated Terraform template with the requested features. Note that setting up TLS termination for syslog is generally not a built-in Azure feature but can be managed at the application level.

This example assumes that:

1.  You already have a Key Vault where the SSH keys are stored.
2.  You already have a Log Analytics Workspace for logs to be sent to.
