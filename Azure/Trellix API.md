> you are a microsoft development engineer who specialises in integrating external security products into the Azure Sentinel SIEM service so as to collect logs and alerts from external service into Sentinel. We will build an use an Azure Function App to poll the Fireeye EX API to collect security alerts and supporting data into Sentinel

Sure, I can help with that. The task involves a number of steps, including creating an Azure Function App, setting up the Fireeye EX API, integrating the two, and finally setting up Azure Sentinel to receive the data.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1.  **Create an Azure Function App**: This is a cloud service available on Azure that lets you run small pieces of code (called "functions") without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it.
    
2.  **Set up the Fireeye EX API**: You'll need to configure the Fireeye EX security product's API. This will usually involve generating an API key or setting up OAuth2, and noting down the endpoints you need to hit to get the data you're interested in.
    
3.  **Write the function**: The function that runs in your Azure Function App will need to call the Fireeye EX API, collect the response, and then format that response into a format that can be consumed by Azure Sentinel.
    
4.  **Integrate with Azure Sentinel**: Azure Sentinel provides a number of ways to ingest data, such as via the Azure Monitor, Logic Apps, or even directly via its API. You'll need to choose the appropriate one and then set up your Azure Function App to send its data to Azure Sentinel.
    

Please note that the specifics of these steps can vary based on your exact setup and requirements.

Would you like more detailed guidance on any of these steps?

> Yes, give me detailed information including the code required in step one. Any code must have detailed markup explaining the code

Sure, I can help with creating an Azure Function App.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Log into Azure Portal**: Go to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with your Azure account.
    
2.  **Create a Function App**: On the Azure portal home page, click on "Create a resource". In the search box, type "Function App" and select it from the dropdown list. Click "Create" on the new window that opens.
    
3.  **Configure the Function App**: You'll now need to fill in the details for your new Function App.
    
    *   **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription you want to use.
    *   **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
    *   **Function App name**: Choose a unique name for your function app.
    *   **Publish**: Choose Code.
    *   **Runtime stack**: Select the programming language you want to use. In our case, let's choose Python.
    *   **Version**: Choose the version of the language you want to use.
    *   **Region**: Select the region closest to you or your users.
4.  **Review and Create**: Review your settings and click "Create".
    
5.  **Create a Function**: After the Function App is deployed, go to the "Functions" section in the Function App and click "Add". Choose "HTTP trigger" as the template, give it a name and select the authorization level (in most cases, you can select "Function").
    

Here's a simple example of a Python function that you can use as a starting point. This function just returns a 'Hello, Azure!' message:

python

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    return func.HttpResponse("Hello, Azure!")
```

This code first imports the necessary modules. The `logging` module is used to log diagnostic information, and the `azure.functions` module contains classes and methods needed for Azure functions.

The `main` function is the entry point for your code. It takes an `HttpRequest` object as a parameter, which contains information about the incoming HTTP request.

Inside `main`, a log entry is created with the message 'Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.' Then, an `HttpResponse` object is returned, with the body set to "Hello, Azure!".

This is just a placeholder function to get you started. The next step would be to replace this code with your function that calls the Fireeye EX API, processes the response, and sends the data to Azure Sentinel.

> This is what we need to ingest with the function app Alert summary request Gets a list of advanced threat alerts in summary format. The response is in chronological order. The list can be filtered by specifying the search attributes. If no attributes are passed, a sorted (starting from the oldest) list of alerts is returned based on their last modified status time.

Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was an error in processing the source code you provided. However, if you're looking to create an Azure Function to interact with FireEye's API, here's a sample Python code you might find useful:

Please note that this is a simple example and doesn't handle all possible edge cases or errors. You might need to add more robust error handling based on your specific needs. Also, remember to secure your API key and any sensitive data. Don't hard-code them into your script. Instead, use Azure's secure storage options, such as Key Vault or App Configuration, to store these values securely.

python

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import requests
import json

FIRE_EYE_API_KEY = "<API_KEY>"
FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT = "https://<etp_instance_addr>/api/v1/alerts"

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    # Define the headers for the API request
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-fireeye-api-key': FIRE_EYE_API_KEY
    }

    # Define the body of the API request
    # This is a basic example, you might need to adjust this based on your needs
    body = {
        "fromLastModifiedOn": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",  # Adjust this date based on your needs
        "size": 100  # The number of alerts to fetch
    }

    # Make the API request
    response = requests.post(FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(body))

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the response JSON
        response_json = response.json()

        # Log the total number of alerts
        total_alerts = response_json['meta']['total']
        logging.info(f"Total alerts: {total_alerts}")

        # You can now process the alerts as you wish
        # For this example, we're just returning them as the function response
        return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(response_json))

    else:
        # If the request failed, log the status code and return a failure message
        logging.error(f"Fireeye API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
        return func.HttpResponse("Failed to fetch alerts from Fireeye API", status_code=500)
```

Please replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key and `<etp_instance_addr>` with your actual Fireeye instance address. Adjust the `fromLastModifiedOn` date and `size` based on your needs. This is a very basic example and doesn't handle errors or edge cases, so you might need to add more code to handle these situations in a real-world application.

> this must poll the api every second

To make your Azure Function poll the FireEye API every second, you could set up a Timer Trigger. However, it's important to note that making API requests at such a high frequency could lead to rate limiting or other issues, depending on the API's usage policies. Please make sure to check FireEye's API documentation for details on request limits and best practices.

Here's an example of how you could modify the Azure Function to use a Timer Trigger that runs every second:

python

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import requests
import json

FIRE_EYE_API_KEY = "<API_KEY>"
FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT = "https://<etp_instance_addr>/api/v1/alerts"

def main(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
    logging.info('Python timer trigger function processed a request.')

    # Define the headers for the API request
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-fireeye-api-key': FIRE_EYE_API_KEY
    }

    # Define the body of the API request
    # This is a basic example, you might need to adjust this based on your needs
    body = {
        "fromLastModifiedOn": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",  # Adjust this date based on your needs
        "size": 100  # The number of alerts to fetch
    }

    # Make the API request
    response = requests.post(FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(body))

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the response JSON
        response_json = response.json()

        # Log the total number of alerts
        total_alerts = response_json['meta']['total']
        logging.info(f"Total alerts: {total_alerts}")

    else:
        # If the request failed, log the status code
        logging.error(f"Fireeye API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
```

In the `function.json` file associated with your Azure Function, you would set the schedule to `"0 */1 * * * *"` to make it run every second:

json

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "mytimer",
      "type": "timerTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "schedule": "0 */1 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

Remember to replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key and `<etp_instance_addr>` with your actual Fireeye instance address. Adjust the `fromLastModifiedOn` date based on your needs. This is a very basic example and doesn't handle errors or edge cases, so you might need to add more code to handle these situations in a real-world application.

Please be aware that rapidly polling an API every second might not be the best approach, depending on your use case. It could potentially put a lot of load on the API server and might result in your IP address or API key being blocked due to excessive requests. If the data you're retrieving doesn't change very frequently, it might be more appropriate to poll at a less frequent interval.

> using the following guide we need to send the data from the function app to Sentinel Using Azure Functions to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source. Do not browse the web and use the following for reference Prerequisites Configure and connect your data source Find your data Validate connectivity Next steps You can use Azure Functions, in conjunction with various coding languages such as PowerShell or Python, to create a serverless connector to the REST API endpoints of your compatible data sources. Azure Function Apps then allow you to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source's REST API to pull in logs. This article describes how to configure Microsoft Sentinel for using Azure Function Apps. You may also need to configure your source system, and you can find vendor- and product-specific information links in each data connector's page in the portal, or the section for your service in the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference page. Note Once ingested in to Microsoft Sentinel, data is stored in the geographic location of the workspace in which you're running Microsoft Sentinel. For long term retention, you may also want to store data in Azure Data Explorer. For more information, see Integrate Azure Data Explorer. Using Azure Functions to ingest data into Microsoft Sentinel may result in additional data ingestion costs. For more information, see the Azure Functions pricing page. Prerequisites Make sure that you have the following permissions and credentials before using Azure Functions to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source and pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel: You must have read and write permissions on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace. Learn more about workspace keys. You must have read and write permissions on Azure Functions to create a Function App. Learn more about Azure Functions. You will also need credentials for accessing the product's API - either a username and password, a token, a key, or some other combination. You may also need other API information such as an endpoint URI. For more information, see the documentation for the service you're connecting to and the section for your service in the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference page. Install the solution that contains your Azure Functions-based connector from the Content Hub in Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box content. Configure and connect your data source Note You can securely store workspace and API authorization keys or tokens in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. Follow these instructions to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App. Some data connectors depend on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected. See the section for your service in the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference page for links to instructions to create the Kusto function and alias. STEP 1 - Get your source system's API credentials Follow your source system's instructions to get its API credentials / authorization keys / tokens. Copy and paste them into a text file for later. You can find details on the exact credentials you'll need, and links to your product's instructions for finding or creating them, on the data connector page in the portal and in the section for your service in the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference page. You may also need to configure logging or other settings on your source system. You'll find the relevant instructions together with those in the preceding paragraph. STEP 2 - Deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function App Choose a deployment option Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template Manual deployment with PowerShell Manual deployment with Python This method provides an automated deployment of your Azure Function-based connector using an ARM template. In the Microsoft Sentinel portal, select Data connectors. Select your Azure Functions-based connector from the list, and then Open connector page. Under Configuration, copy the Microsoft Sentinel workspace ID and primary key and paste them aside. Select Deploy to Azure. (You may have to scroll down to find the button.) The Custom deployment screen will appear. Select a subscription, resource group, and region in which to deploy your Function App. Enter your API credentials / authorization keys / tokens that you saved in Step 1 above. Enter your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace ID and Workspace Key (primary key) that you copied and put aside. Note If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier}) schema in place of the string values. Refer to Key Vault references documentation for further details. Complete any other fields in the form on the Custom deployment screen. See your data connector page in the portal or the section for your service in the Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference page. Select Review + create. When the validation completes, select Create.

It appears you're looking to set up Azure Functions to pull data from your FireEye API and then send that data to Microsoft Sentinel for further analysis and monitoring. I'll guide you through the general steps on how to achieve this based on the guide you provided.

1.  **Install the Solution in Microsoft Sentinel**: Microsoft Sentinel offers various solutions that you can install from its Content Hub. These solutions contain out-of-the-box content for specific data sources, including Azure Functions-based connectors. If a suitable solution is available, install it.
    
2.  **Get Your FireEye API Credentials**: You need to retrieve your FireEye API key or any other required authentication information. This information will be used to authenticate your requests when your Azure Function polls the FireEye API.
    
3.  **Deploy Azure Function App with the FireEye API Connector**:
    
    **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template Method**:
    
    *   Navigate to the Microsoft Sentinel portal and select Data connectors. From the list, choose your Azure Functions-based connector for FireEye and open its connector page.
    *   Under Configuration, copy the Microsoft Sentinel workspace ID and primary key and keep them handy.
    *   Click on Deploy to Azure. This will navigate you to the Custom deployment screen.
    *   On the Custom deployment screen, choose the appropriate subscription, resource group, and region to deploy your Function App.
    *   Enter the FireEye API credentials you retrieved earlier.
    *   Enter your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace ID and Workspace Key that you copied earlier.
    *   If you're using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values, use the `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})` schema instead of the string values.
    *   Complete any other fields required for your specific connector.
    *   Click Review + create. Once the validation completes, click Create.
4.  **Configure Your Azure Function App to Connect to FireEye API and Microsoft Sentinel**: With the Azure Function App deployed, you'll need to configure it to connect to both the FireEye API and your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. This involves setting up the API requests to FireEye, parsing the responses, and then sending the relevant data to Sentinel.
    
    Here is a high-level sketch of what the Azure Function might look like:
    
    python
    
    ```python
    import logging
    import azure.functions as func
    import requests
    import json
    
    FIRE_EYE_API_KEY = "<API_KEY>"
    FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT = "https://<etp_instance_addr>/api/v1/alerts"
    SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID = "<Workspace ID>"
    SENTINEL_PRIMARY_KEY = "<Primary Key>"
    
    def main(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
        logging.info('Python timer trigger function processed a request.')
    
        # Define the headers for the FireEye API request
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-fireeye-api-key': FIRE_EYE_API_KEY
        }
    
        # Define the body of the API request
        # This is a basic example, you might need to adjust this based on your needs
        body = {
            "fromLastModifiedOn": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",  # Adjust this date based on your needs
            "size": 100  # The number of alerts to fetch
        }
    
        # Make the FireEye API request
        response = requests.post(FIRE_EYE_API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(body))
    
        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Parse the response JSON
            response_json = response.json()
    
            # Now send the parsed data to Sentinel
            send_to_sentinel(response_json)
    
        else:
            # If the request failed, log the status code
            logging.error(f"Fireeye API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
    
    def send_to_sentinel(data):
        # This is a placeholder function. You'll need to implement
        # sending data to Sentinel based on Sentinel's API and your requirements.
        logging.info(f"Sending data to Sentinel: {data}")
    ```
    
5.  **Schedule Your Azure Function to Run Regularly**: As previously discussed, you can set up your Azure Function to run on a schedule using a Timer Trigger. Make sure to adjust the schedule based on your needs and FireEye's API usage policies.
    
6.  **Test and Monitor Your Azure Function**: Once everything is set up, you should test your Azure Function to make sure it's working correctly. You can monitor its execution in the Azure portal, and you should also set up error handling and logging in your Azure Function code so that you can troubleshoot any issues that arise.
    

Please note that you will need to replace `<API_KEY>`, `<etp_instance_addr>`, `<Workspace ID>`, and `<Primary Key>` with your actual values.

Remember, these steps are a high-level guideline and might need to be adapted based on your specific requirements and the specifics of FireEye's API and Microsoft Sentinel. Always refer to the official documentation and best practices when working with these services.

The webpage you provided is a detailed guide on how to use the Email Security — Cloud RESTful APIs, which are used for custom integration. The APIs are provided for Advanced Threats, Email Trace, and Quarantine functionalities​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​. Here are some key points from the guide:

1.  **API Key Configuration**: To call the APIs, you must first configure the API keys. This involves logging into the Email Cloud Web Portal or IAM console, specifying the API key name, expiration time, and products (selecting both "Email Threat Prevention" and "Identity Access Management"). For API access, certain entitlements are required, which differ depending on whether you're accessing alerts APIs, trace APIs, or quarantine APIs​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​. Once the API key is created, it can be downloaded or copied​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
2.  **Service Regions and Access Control**: The URLs for the region that hosts your Email Cloud service are specified, and all API requests follow the domain and domain group restrictions of the user​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
3.  **REST API Concurrency**: The Email Cloud REST APIs have a rate limit of 60 requests per minute per API route (/trace, /alert, and /quarantine) for every customer, which applies to the customer as a whole, not per API key​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
4.  **Response Data Size**: The email trace API endpoints are configured to return a maximum of 300 records in the response for every request, while the alert and quarantine API endpoints return a maximum of 200 records​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
5.  **Enhancing REST API Performance**: The guide suggests running requests in parallel, especially for large datasets, by making efficient use of the search filters supported by the APIs​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​. Examples of such parallel requests for the quarantine and trace functionalities are given​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
6.  **Advanced Threat APIs**: Several APIs are listed for handling advanced threats, such as for alert summary, alert details, download alert artifacts, acknowledge or delete alerts, and more​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​. The alert summary request, for instance, gets a list of advanced threat alerts in summary format and can be filtered by specifying the search attributes​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
7.  **Parameters and Headers**: When making requests, certain headers are required, such as `x-fireeye-api-key` which specifies your personal API key. The request body can contain a variety of parameters, none of which are mandatory. These parameters can be used in any combination and include `legacy_id`, `etp_message_id`, `email_status`, and `alert_types`​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    

This is a high-level summary of the guide. If you have specific questions about any part of this guide or want more details, please let me know!

> We want to ingest all of the current alerts into our sentinel Siem what are the limits of the API to ingest data

When it comes to ingesting data from the Email Security — Cloud RESTful APIs into your Sentinel SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), there are a few key limits to be aware of:

1.  **Rate Limit**: The Email Cloud REST APIs have a rate limit of 60 requests per minute per API route (/trace, /alert, and /quarantine) for every customer. This rate limit applies to the customer as a whole, not per API key. In other words, if you make 60 requests to the Alert API in one minute, the 61st request within that minute would result in a rate limit exceeded error​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
2.  **Response Size Limit**: For the alert API endpoint, each response to a request is configured to return a maximum of 200 records. If the size specified in the request is greater than 200, a response size exceeded error is returned by the API. If the size specified in the request is 0 or a negative number, the API returns only metadata information indicating the total number of records, and does not return the actual records in the response​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    
3.  **Optimizing Data Ingestion**: In cases where you have a large number of records to retrieve, the guide suggests enhancing performance by running requests in parallel. This could be accomplished by splitting the request into multiple parallel requests having distinct sets of domains in each request. This approach could significantly enhance the response time per request, allowing more information to be returned within the rate limit window​[1](https://ctxt.io/2/AACQX4k7Eg)​.
    

Please note that due to these limits, ingesting a large amount of data may require careful planning and may need to be done over a period of time rather than all at once. Also, the number of existing alerts and the frequency of new alerts being generated will impact how quickly and effectively you can ingest all alerts into your Sentinel SIEM.

> Generate a javascript code that the will ingest a large amount of data for the first week as there is alot of historical data. the message ID is critical

Here's a simple JavaScript example using the node-fetch package to retrieve data from the Alert API endpoint, taking into account the rate limit and response size limit. This example does not include any error handling or retries, which would be necessary for a production-level script.

The script will fetch 200 records at a time (the maximum allowed), and will wait 1 second between each fetch to respect the 60 requests per minute rate limit. Note that the script does not currently handle any pagination that may be required if there are more than 200 alerts to fetch.

javascript

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';
const instanceUrl = 'https://your_instance_url_here/api/v1';
const limit = 200; // max number of alerts to fetch in each request

async function getAlerts() {
    const url = `${instanceUrl}/alerts`;

    const headers = {
        'x-fireeye-api-key': apiKey
    };

    const body = {
        'attributes': {
            'size': limit
        }
    };

    const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
        headers: headers
    });

    if (response.ok) {
        const json = await response.json();
        return json;
    } else {
        console.error(`Error: ${response.status}`);
        return null;
    }
}

async function ingestAlerts() {
    let moreData = true;
    while (moreData) {
        const alerts = await getAlerts();
        if (alerts && alerts.length > 0) {
            // Process the alerts here, e.g., send them to your SIEM

            // Pause for 1 second to respect rate limit
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        } else {
            moreData = false;
        }
    }
}

ingestAlerts();
```

This script needs to be adjusted to your specific needs. In this script, replace `'your_api_key_here'` and `'https://your_instance_url_here/api/v1'` with your actual API key and your actual instance URL, respectively.

Also, please install the `node-fetch` package by running `npm install node-fetch` in your terminal before running this script.

Please note that the actual integration with your Sentinel SIEM is not implemented in this script, as the specifics of that integration would depend on the Sentinel API and how you want to structure the data. The `// Process the alerts here, e.g., send them to your SIEM` comment is where you would add the code to send the alerts to your SIEM.

This code assumes you're running it in an environment where `async/await` syntax is available. If you're running this in an older Node.js environment, you may need to refactor to use Promises directly.

Remember, this is a basic script and does not include advanced features such as error handling, logging, retries, or pagination handling. You may need to enhance this script to meet your production-level needs.

> what code does an azure function app support?

Azure Functions support several languages for writing your functions. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following languages are supported:

1.  **C#**: The .NET languages, including C#, are fully supported on Azure Functions, and are typically written using .NET Core.
    
2.  **JavaScript**: JavaScript is supported on Azure Functions using Node.js.
    
3.  **F#**: F# is another .NET language that is supported on Azure Functions.
    
4.  **Java**: Java is supported on Azure Functions. You can write your functions using popular Java frameworks and tools.
    
5.  **Python**: Python is supported on Azure Functions. This is often used for data processing or machine learning tasks.
    
6.  **PowerShell**: PowerShell is supported on Azure Functions, and is typically used for automation tasks.
    
7.  **TypeScript**: TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, is also supported.
    

Keep in mind that Azure periodically updates and expands its support for languages, so there may be more languages supported beyond this list at the time you're reading this.

> can i create a function app with terraform

Yes, you can create an Azure Function App using Terraform. Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to manage and provision cloud resources in a declarative way using configuration files.

Below is a basic example of how you can define an Azure Function App using Terraform:

hcl

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "azure-functions-csharp-example"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "functionsapptestsa"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "example" {
  name                = "azure-functions-test-service-plan"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name                       = "test-azure-functions"
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  app_service_plan_id        = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id
  storage_connection_string  = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_connection_string
}
```

This example creates a new resource group, storage account, app service plan, and function app. Note that you'll need to replace the placeholder values with your actual values.

Before running Terraform scripts, make sure you have installed Terraform and authenticated with Azure. You might need to run `terraform init` to initialize your Terraform workspace, and then use `terraform apply` to create the resources.

Remember to always use `terraform plan` first to preview the changes before applying them.
