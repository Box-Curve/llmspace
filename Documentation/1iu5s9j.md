During my tenure at the Bank of Ireland, I spearheaded a significant transformation project focused on enhancing the security of the bank's digital infrastructure in response to risk findings from the European Central Bank. This high-priority program, tasked with establishing the Security Operations Center (SOC) and implementing necessary tooling and processes, included the following key accomplishments:

1.  **Implementation of Azure Sentinel**: Following an exhaustive RFP process, I led the selection and implementation of a new Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool: Azure Sentinel, part of the Microsoft 365 E5 Mobility and Security suite. This initiative upgraded our event and analytics capabilities, thereby strengthening our ability to detect, prevent, and respond to security threats.
    
2.  **Establishment of Azure Landing Zone**: In order to leverage Azure Sentinel, I managed the setup of a new Azure Landing Zone, compliant with the bank's stringent security standards. This required creating a secure connection to our core network using ExpressRoute. This work also involved operationalizing the Azure environment, marking a significant shift for the bank, which has traditionally relied on AWS.
    
3.  **Integration of ServiceNow SecOps SIR and Sentinel**: To enhance our enterprise ServiceNow ITSM solution, I oversaw the implementation and integration of ServiceNow SecOps Security Incident Response (SIR) with Azure Sentinel. This integration streamlined incident management, driving faster responses to security threats and tighter collaboration between teams.
    
4.  **Development of New Security Operations Centre (SOC)**: A crucial part of this transformation was the establishment of a new SOC for the bank. This center significantly enhanced our capabilities to monitor, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats, bolstering the overall security posture of the bank.
    

My role in this program has equipped me with a deep understanding of digital security in the banking sector and extensive experience in the selection, implementation, and operationalization of security tools and processes. I'm well-versed in working with both Azure and AWS environments and adept at leading and managing significant transformation projects.

Your CV is quite extensive and comprehensive. I can see you have detailed your achievements in your various roles, which is excellent. I have a few suggestions that may help make your CV even more impactful:

1.  **Highlight achievements:** Your CV does a good job of detailing your responsibilities in each role. It would be even more effective if you could clearly highlight the key achievements in each role separately. The 'Key contributions and successes' sections are great, but try to quantify these achievements where possible. Numbers can speak louder than words in a CV. For instance, instead of saying 'Developed and implemented migration strategy...' you could say 'Developed and implemented migration strategy that led to a XX% increase in efficiency...'
    
2.  **Tailor your CV:** Make sure you're tailoring your CV to each job you apply for. While you have a wide range of skills and experiences, make sure you highlight the most relevant ones for the job you're applying to.
    
3.  **Professional Accreditations:** I see that you have a number of professional accreditations. It might be helpful to provide a brief description of what each accreditation is, as not all hiring managers will be familiar with each one.
    
4.  **Early Career:** For your early career roles, consider adding a brief description of your responsibilities and key accomplishments, as you did for your more recent roles. If space is an issue, you can remove this section and instead focus on the last 10-15 years of your career.
    
5.  **Summary section:** Consider revising your summary section to make it more concise and focused on your key qualifications and career goals. Try to limit it to 3-4 sentences that encapsulate your experience and aspirations.
    
6.  **Formatting:** Be consistent in your formatting. Make sure you're using the same font, font size, and style throughout. This will make your CV easier to read and more professional-looking.
    

Remember, a CV should ideally be no more than 2 pages. If you're struggling to fit everything into two pages, focus on the most relevant and impressive parts of your experience. You can go into more detail in your cover letter or during the interview.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Programme Manager at Bank of Ireland

I am currently leading an extensive security transformation project as part of the response to the ECB risk findings at the Bank of Ireland. My responsibilities span implementing Azure Sentinel as our new SIEM tool, operationalizing the Azure environment within the traditionally AWS-based infrastructure of the bank, and integrating ServiceNow SecOps SIR with our enterprise ITSM solution.

A crucial aspect of my role has been to set up a new physical Security Operations Centre (SOC), which involved conducting an RFP process, managing an impressive budget of 10 million euros, and developing new agile SOC operations and governance processes. The project has allowed me to further expand my project management skills, overseeing the coordination of eight delivery vendors, multiple contracted consultants, and in-house project managers.

In our pursuit of innovation and efficiency, I have spearheaded the implementation of automated workflows and the integration of Microsoft Teams, Azure DevOps, Sentinel, and ServiceNow into a cohesive collaboration platform. As the programme manager, I also led a global storage transformation, consolidating NetApp arrays, and EMC VMAX as part of an M&A consolidation initiative.

In the dynamic landscape of IT, I continuously strive to deliver solutions that meet strategic objectives and fortify the institution's security infrastructure.

I've led the deployment and integration of the M365 E5 Security and Mobility suite, bolstering our cybersecurity capabilities. This has been further supplemented by operationalizing the Azure environment within a bank ecosystem that traditionally leans on AWS. Another key accomplishment has been the successful integration of ServiceNow SecOps SIR with our enterprise ITSM solution, optimizing response times and streamlining processes.

A critical part of my role has been to establish a new physical Security Operations Centre (SOC).

Furthermore, we've seen significant improvements through the implementation of automated workflows and the integration of Microsoft Teams, Azure DevOps, Sentinel, and ServiceNow into a collaborative platform. These measures have not only improved efficiency but also fostered a collaborative culture among our teams.

Navigating the ever-evolving landscape of IT, my role has always been about providing the most robust and innovative solutions to meet our strategic goals and secure the institution's digital assets.
