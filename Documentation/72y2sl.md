> give me an example table to work from

1 / 1

Certainly, here's an example of a simplified CMDB table that you might use as a starting point. Note that in an actual production environment, a CMDB table would typically be much more complex and contain many more attributes for each CI.

```
| CI ID | CI Type | CI Name | Resource Group | Location | Status | Owner | Description | Relationship/Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Virtual Machine | VM\_DB01 | RG\_DB | East US | Running | John Doe | Database Server VM | Dependent on 1004 |
| 1002 | Virtual Network | VNet\_Main | RG\_Network | East US | Active | Jane Smith | Main Virtual Network | Connects 1001, 1003 |
| 1003 | Storage Account | SA\_Images | RG\_Storage | East US | Active | Alan Turing | Image Blob Storage | Accessed by 1001 |
| 1004 | SQL Database | SQLDB\_Main | RG\_DB | East US | Online | Emily White | Main SQL Database | Accessed by 1001 |
```

### Explanation of Columns:

*   **CI ID:** A unique identifier for each Configuration Item.
    
*   **CI Type:** The type/category of the Azure resource, such as Virtual Machine, Virtual Network, etc.
    
*   **CI Name:** The name of the Configuration Item as it is identified in Azure.
    
*   **Resource Group:** The Azure resource group to which the CI belongs.
    
*   **Location:** The Azure region where the CI is deployed.
    
*   **Status:** The current operational status of the CI (e.g., Running, Stopped, Deleted, etc.)
    
*   **Owner:** The individual or team responsible for managing the CI.
    
*   **Description:** A brief description of the CI.
    
*   **Relationship/Dependency:** Represents the relationship or dependency between different CIs. For instance, a VM may access a particular storage account, thus forming a dependency.
    

This table is a simple and generic structure and would need to be expanded upon to cover all the attributes and relationships in a real-world scenario, especially considering various Azure services and their respective properties and configurations.

Also, remember that when using a platform like ServiceNow, relationships would often be represented in a separate relational database table or a similar structure, enabling more complex and scalable management of CI relationships and dependencies.
